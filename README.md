The goal of this project is to develop a parser and lexer for a simplifide version of the python programming language.
The following are the supported features of our simplified python language

* Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=) 
* Variable definitions
* if/else blocks 
* Conditional statements (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, and, or, not)

* Comments 
* Function implementations 
* Function calls 

Additionally, this project generates png images of the parse tree generated
